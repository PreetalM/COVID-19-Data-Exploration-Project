# COVID-19 Data Exploration Project

This project explores COVID-19 data from Feb 2020-Jan 2023. Basic to advanced SQL queries are executed to answer questions and look at trends over the course of COVID-19. After the data exploration is complete in SQL, the queries are used to create some data visualizations in Tableau. My data exploration in SQL can be viewed [here](https://github.com/PreetalM/COVID-19-Data-Exploration-Project/blob/main/Feb%202020%20-%20Jan%202023%20COVID%20-%20Data%20Exploration.sql) and my dashboard in Tableau [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/preetal/viz/CovidDashboard_16747568011090/Dashboard1). This project was built using 
SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

## The Data

The dataset is from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths). I extracted the data in Excel and performed data quality checks to ensure clean state in the data source.

## Task

The goal of this project is to explore 2020-2022 COVID-19 Data by performing queries in SQL. I choose to look at insights for the United States since I am currently living here. I also explored data globally and regionally.


## Key Findings
 - As of 11/01/2023, there have been 101,369,936 COVID-19 cases in the US. The current US death percentage is about 1.095%, meaning there is about a 1.1% chance of dying if you contract COVID-19.
 - While the number of cases has increased in total, the death percentage has declined. One year ago, there was a ~1.6% chance of dying upon contraction in the US. Two years ago, ~2% chance of dying upon contraction.
 - The highest infection rate is among European countries. The country with the highest infection rate is Cyprus. Of course this is relative to their population.
 - The US has an infection rate of ~29%. In 2020, the US infection rate was ~3.7%. In 2021 it was ~14.2%. The infection rate now it almost 8 times as much as it was in 2020 and twice as much as it was in 2021.
 - Presently, there are 637,876,021 cases and 6,588,157 deaths worldwide due to COVID-19. The current global death percentage is 1.03282719260582%.
 - As of right now, North America has the highest death count due to COVID-19
 - 10,703,463,448 people worldwide have been vaccinated with at least one vaccine, that's 0.13% of the global population.
